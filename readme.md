# ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Practice Repo

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Practice Journey**.
This repo is structured to help me systematically learn and practice **visualization, preprocessing, data mining, and ML/DL interpretation**.

Iâ€™ll be using multiple datasets (Titanic, House Prices, MNIST, Credit Card Fraud, Market Basket, etc.) and applying concepts one by one.

## **Stage 2 â€” Preprocessing**

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Clean, transform, and prepare data for ML/DL.

### Data Cleaning

* [ ] Handle missing values (drop, mean, median, KNN)
* [ ] Remove duplicates
* [ ] Detect & treat outliers

### Data Transformation

* [ ] Normalization (Min-Max scaling)
* [ ] Standardization (Z-score)
* [ ] Log transform
* [ ] Box-Cox / Power transform

### Feature Engineering

* [ ] Encode categorical (Label, One-hot, Embeddings)
* [ ] Polynomial features
* [ ] Binning/discretization
* [ ] Group-based scaling

### Dimensionality Reduction

* [ ] PCA
* [ ] t-SNE
* [ ] UMAP
* [ ] LDA (classification-based)

### DL-Specific Preprocessing

* [ ] Signal filtering (low-pass, band-pass, notch)
* [ ] Image denoising (Gaussian, median, wavelet)
* [ ] Image augmentation (flip, crop, rotation, cutout, mixup)
* [ ] Data balancing (SMOTE, oversampling, undersampling)

---

## **Stage 3 â€” Data Mining**

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Extract hidden patterns & knowledge.

### Association Rule Learning

* [ ] Apriori algorithm
* [ ] FP-Growth

### Clustering

* [ ] K-Means

## **Stage 4 â€” Modeling & Interpretation**

ðŸ‘‰ Goal: Train simple models & visualize their behavior.

* [ ] Logistic Regression (Titanic dataset)
* [ ] Random Forest (House Prices)
* [ ] CNN (MNIST dataset)
* [ ] Plot ROC, PR, confusion matrix for models
* [ ] Plot learning curves (train vs val loss/accuracy)
* [ ] Visualize feature importance (trees, SHAP)
* [ ] Grad-CAM on CNN (MNIST/CIFAR images)

# ðŸš€ Datasets to Use

* **Titanic** â†’ missing values, categorical encoding, classification
* **House Prices** â†’ regression, feature engineering
* **MNIST / CIFAR** â†’ image preprocessing, CNNs, Grad-CAM
* **Credit Card Fraud** â†’ imbalanced data, anomaly detection
* **Market Basket Data** â†’ association rule mining (Apriori, FP-Growth)

# âœ… Progress Tracking

Iâ€™ll tick each method off as I implement it in the notebooks.
Goal is to have a **complete practical library** of EDA, preprocessing, and data mining techniques.
